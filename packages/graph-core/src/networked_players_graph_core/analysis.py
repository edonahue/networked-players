"""Proxy ranking for album curation: release-variant count x credit richness.

This is the medium-term mechanism for growing the editorial album list
(data/albums/top-albums-v1.json) beyond hand-picked entries -- a signal to
look at, not an automatic ranking. Output is a local-only shortlist; it is
never committed (see data/albums/README.md).
